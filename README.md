# ambient tutorial
this tutorial for the ambient game engine features a proof of concept for an alternative coding tutorial format.
it features a sidebar that displays what code has been explained so far in the tutorial.
oftentimes tutorials will just tell you what snippets go where, and the reader can either
make a mistake or lose track of something. this format solves that problem by having the tutorial *explain*
the code, and having the sidebar show a cohesive program.
